The `HouseCanary <http://www.housecanary.com>`_ API Python Client provides an easy interface to call the HouseCanary API.


API documentation
-----------------

Full documentation is available at https://api-docs.housecanary.com

Installation
------------

To install:

::

    pip install housecanary

Basic Usage
-----------

.. code:: python

    import housecanary
    client = housecanary.ApiClient("my_api_key", "my_api_secret")
    result = client.property.value(("10216 N Willow Ave", "64157"))

    # result is an instance of housecanary.response.Response
    print result.json()

Authentication
--------------

When you create an instance of an ApiClient, you need to give it your
API key and secret. You can manage these in your settings page at
https://valuereport.housecanary.com/#/settings/api-settings.

You can pass these values to the ApiClient constructor:

.. code:: python

    client = housecanary.ApiClient("my_api_key", "my_api_secret")

Alternatively, instead of passing in your key and secret to the
constructor, you can store them in the following environment variables:

-  HC\_API\_KEY
-  HC\_API\_SECRET

Creating an instance of ApiClient with no arguments will read your key
and secret from those environment variables:

.. code:: python

    client = housecanary.ApiClient()

Usage Details
-------------

Endpoint methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ApiClient class provides a ``property`` wrapper which contains
various methods for calling the endpoints of the Value Report, Rental Report and Analytics APIs:

Analytics API Endpoints:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **census**
-  **details**
-  **flood**
-  **ltv**
-  **ltv_details**
-  **mortgage_lien**
-  **msa_details**
-  **nod**
-  **owner_occupied**
-  **rental_value**
-  **sales_history**
-  **school**
-  **value**
-  **value_forecase**
-  **zip_details**
-  **zip_hpi_forecast**
-  **zip_hpi_historical**
-  **zip_volatility**
-  **component_mget**

Value Report API Endpoint:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **value_report**

Rental Report API Endpoint:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **rental_report**

More wrapper objects may be added to ApiClient later like "zipcode" and
"lat\_lng".

**Args:**
     

All of the Analytics API endpoint methods take an
``address_data`` argument. ``address_data`` can be in one of two forms:

A Json formatted list like:

.. code:: python

    [{"address":"82 County Line Rd", "zipcode":"72173", "meta":"extra info"}]

Or, a list of (address, zipcode, meta) tuples like:

.. code:: python

    [("82 County Line Rd", "72173", "extra info")]

The "meta" field is optional. If you're only providing one address, you
can provide a tuple on it's own:

.. code:: python

    ("82 County Line Rd", "72173")

All of the endpoint methods of this class return a Response object or
the output of a custom OutputGenerator if one was specified in the
constructor.

**Example:**
        

.. code:: python

    client = housecanary.ApiClient()
    result = client.property.value([("10216 N Willow Ave", "64157"), ("82 County Line Rd", "72173")])

**Value Report:**
             

The ``value_report`` method behaves differently than the other endpoint
methods. It only supports one address at a time, and it takes some
extra, optional parameters:

Args: 
    - *address* (str) 
    - *zipcode* (str)

Kwargs: 
    - *report\_type* - "full" or "summary". Optional. Default is "full"
    - *format\_type* - "json", "pdf", "xlsx" or "all". Optional. Default is "json"

**Example:**
        

.. code:: python

    client = housecanary.ApiClient()
    # get Value Report in JSON format with "summary" report_type.
    result = client.property.value_report("10216 N Willow Ave", "64157", "summary", "json")
    # print the JSON output
    print result.json()

    # get Value Report in PDF format with "full" report_type.
    result = client.property.value_report("10216 N Willow Ave", "64157", format_type="pdf")
    # result is binary data of the PDF.

**Rental Report**

The ``rental_report`` method is for calling the Rental Report API. It only supports one address at a time.

Args:
    - *address* (str)
    - *zipcode* (str)

Kwargs: 
    - *format\_type* - "json", "xlsx" or "all". Optional. Default is "json"

Learn more about the various endpoints in the `API docs. <https://api-docs.housecanary.com/#endpoints>`_


Component_mget endpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may want to retrieve data from multiple Analytics API endpoints in one request. In this case, you can use the ``component_mget`` method. The ``component_mget`` method takes an ``address_data`` argument just like the other endpoint methods. Pass in a list of Analytics API endpoint names as the second argument. Note that ``value_report`` cannot be included.

**Example:**
        

.. code:: python

    client = housecanary.ApiClient()
    result = client.property.component_mget(("10216 N Willow Ave", "64157"), ["property/school", "property/census", "property/details"])


Response
~~~~~~~~

Response is a base class for encapsulating an HTTP response from the
HouseCanary API.

**Properties:**
           

-  **endpoint\_name** - Gets the endpoint name of the original request
-  **response** - Gets the underlying response object.

**Methods:**


-  **json()** - Gets the body of the response from the API as json.
-  **has\_object\_error()** - Returns true if any requested objects had
   a business logic error, otherwise returns false.
-  **get\_object\_errors()** - Gets a list of business error message
   strings for each of the requested objects that had a business error.
   If there was no error, returns an empty list.
-  **objects()** - Overridden in subclasses.
-  **rate_limits** - Returns a list of rate limit information

PropertyResponse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A subclass of Response, this is returned for all property endpoints
except for ``value_report``.

**Methods:**
        

-  **objects()** - Gets a list of Property objects for the requested
   properties, each containing the object's returned json data from the
   API.
-  **properties()** - An alias for the objects() method.

HouseCanaryObject
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Base class for various types of objects returned from the HouseCanary
API. Currently, only the Property subclass is implemented.

**Properties:**
           

-  **component\_results** - a list of ComponentResult objects that
   contain data and error information for each endpoint requested for
   this HouseCanaryObject.

**Methods:**
        

-  **has\_error()** - Returns a boolean of whether there was a business
   logic error fetching data for any components for this object.
-  **get\_errors()** - If there was a business error fetching data for
   any components for this object, returns the error messages.

Property
~~~~~~~~

A subclass of HouseCanaryObject, the Property represents a single
address and it's returned data.

**Properties:**
           

-  **address**
-  **zipcode**
-  **zipcode\_plus4**
-  **address\_full**
-  **city**
-  **country\_fips**
-  **lat**
-  **lng**
-  **state**
-  **unit**
-  **meta**

**Example:**
        

.. code:: python

    result = client.property.value(("123 Main St", "01234", "meta information"))
    p = result.properties()[0]
    print p.address
    # "123 Main St"
    print p.zipcode
    # "01234"
    print p.meta
    # "meta information"
    value_result = p.component_results[0]
    print value_result.component_name
    # 'property/value'
    print value_result.api_code
    # 0
    print value_result.api_code_description
    # 'ok'
    print value_result.json_data
    # {u'value': {u'price_upr': 1575138.0, u'price_lwr': 1326125.0, u'price_mean': 1450632.0, u'fsd': 0.086}}
    print p.has_error()
    # False
    print p.get_errors()
    # []

ValueReportResponse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A subclass of Response, this is the object returned for the
``value_report`` endpoint when "json" format\_type is used. It simply
returns the JSON data of the Value Report.

**Example:**
        

.. code:: python

    result = client.property.value_report("123 Main St", "01234")
    print result.json()
